.Features shared with Grid
[NOTE]
Tree Grid is an extension of the Grid component and all Grid's features are available in Tree Grid as well.

== Tree Column

The tree column is a column that contains the toggles for expanding and collapsing nodes.
Nodes are opened and closed by clicking a tree column's cell.
They can also be toggled programmatically.

== Best Practices

Tree Grid isn't meant to be used as a navigation menu.

.[methodname]`scrollToIndex()` isn't reliable
[CAUTION]
The behavior of the [methodname]`scrollToIndex()` method in Tree Grid isn't deterministic due to lazy-loading hierarchical data.
It isn't recommended to use this method.
