== Global Audience

Vaadin documentation is provided in English for the benefit of users all around the world. For many of these users, English isn't their native language.

For this reason, you need to write in language that's as clear and accessible as possible. The following principles help you achieve that goal.

.Use Short, Simple Sentences
[%collapsible]
====
Consider this example:

[example]
=====
Vaadin components do support client-side validation to increase the responsiveness of the application, but the developer should be aware that these should be used purely for convenience, since they can be circumvented in the browser.
=====

This could be made more easily digestible as follows:

[example]
=====
Vaadin components support client-side validation to increase the responsiveness of the application. However, as a developer, you use this only for convenience, as it's easy to circumvent client-side validation in the browser.
=====

Here is another example, where longer, more complicated sentences can be reduced to shorter, simpler ones:

[example]
=====
For instance, if the developer sets a component to be disabled, this effect is set both on the server and the client. On the client, an attacker can circumvent this (attackers have full control over anything in the browser), but the server blocks any interaction with the component and a warning is printed to the server logs.
=====

This could be improved as follows:

[example]
=====
For example, if the developer sets a component to disabled, it's disabled on both the server and the client. An attacker can circumvent this on the client, because attackers have full control over anything in the browser. However, the server blocks any interaction with the disabled component. The server also prints a warning to the server logs.
=====
====

.Keep the Verb Near the Subject
[%collapsible]
====
Try not to separate the subject from the verb with too many words. This can make the sentence difficult to interpret. Consider the following sentence:

[example]
=====
Data coming from a data store (such as a database) and inserted as HTML into DOM elements (for example, setting innerHTML for elements or using HTML mode in component captions) should also be escaped.
=====

This could be improved as follows:

[example]
=====
If you insert data from a data store into DOM elements as HTML, take care to escape the data first. This would be necessary if, for example, you were using data from a database to set innerHTML, or using HTML mode in component captions.
=====
====

.Use Only One Verb in a Sentence
[%collapsible]
====
For simplicity and ease of understanding, it's a good general aim to try to have only one verb in each sentence.

However, where there is a strong logical connection between clauses (such as implied by words like “while”, “when”, “because”, “so”, “since” and “although”), it may be better to have multiple verbs in a sentence. For example:

[example]
=====
The request isn't available in background threads, so the `isAuthenticated()` method shows authentication state only in Vaadin request processing threads, otherwise it would always return false.
=====

This could be improved as follows:

[example]
=====
The request isn't available in background threads.
For this reason, the `isAuthenticated()` method shows the authentication state only in Vaadin request processing threads. In other cases, it returns false.
=====

== Inclusiveness & Accessibility

In simple terms, _inclusiveness_ means not _excluding_ anybody on an arbitrary basis, such as gender, age, disability, race, religion or sexual orientation.

As far as possible, you want to _include_ people of as wide a range of technical ability as possible. Although Vaadin's technical documentation is aimed at an audience that has a certain level of technical awareness, you must be careful not to make too many assumptions about an individual reader's knowledge and skill set.

It's important to remember that not everybody reads web pages in the same way. For this reason, web content needs to be created in a way that's understood by screen readers.

// TODO needs examples


== Voice & Tone

_Voice_ means how you say what you need to say. But while you're explaining, you also need to adopt an appropriate _tone_.

=== Voice
When you write documentation, you have certain things that you need to communicate to the reader. But there are an infinite number of ways that you could express your message.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.We = NO -->]
As people, we all develop ways of talking to others which say a lot about who we are and how we see the world.
In our documentation, we want to provide important information as clearly as possible.
We would also like people to carry away a favorable impression of who we're and what we stand for as a company.

When you write documentation, you are, at that moment, the public face of the company. If that sounds like a lot of responsibility, don't worry. We all have it in us to be friendly and helpful -- and that's all that's required. You need to remember to write like a real human being who cares about the reading audience.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.We = YES -->]

// TODO needs examples

=== Tone
Tone is more about finding the correct balance between being stiff and formal, and being overly relaxed and flippant. You can take great care to explain issues thoroughly and thoughtfully. But if you use language that's so formal that it sounds unfriendly, or so informal that it sounds unreliable, you risk wasting all the effort that you put into your explanations.

The tone that you're aiming for is friendly. You want to sound professional, but not overly formal.

// TODO needs examples

=== Humor
It's acceptable to use a little humor from time to time. Don't overdo it, however, as it can distract from the message that we're trying to communicate. Additionally, sense of humor is dependent on a person's cultural background. What's funny to us may not be so amusing to someone from a different culture; it may even be offensive.

// TODO needs examples


[[english]]
== Style of English

Use American English (U.S.) style. For example:

[example.recommend]
Customize
[example.avoid]
Customise

[example.recommend]
Color
[example.avoid]
Colour


== Cultural References
Be aware that users of the documentation come from many different cultures. Hence, avoid making references that depend on familiarity with any particular culture.

// TODO needs examples


== Congratulations
Avoid congratulating the reader, for example, for working through a tutorial and completing the process that the tutorial describes. It sounds patronizing. For example:

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Exclamation = NO -->]
[example.recommend]
You've now completed the tutorial.
[example.avoid]
*Well done!* You've now completed the tutorial successfully.


[[exclamations]]
== Exclamation Mark ("!")
Avoid using exclamation marks in technical documentation, unless it's as part of some code syntax. Its use in normal text is distracting and detracts from the professional tone. For example:

[example.recommend]
You've now created your component.
[example.avoid]
You've now created your component**!**

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Exclamation = YES -->]


== Present Tense
In general, use present tense rather than future tense; in particular, try to avoid using will where possible. For example:
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = NO -->]

[example.recommend]
When the compilation is complete, the program *displays* summary information.
[example.avoid]
When the compilation is complete, the program *will display* summary information.


Sometimes future tense is unavoidable because you're actually talking about the future. Attempting to predict the future in a document is usually a bad idea, but sometimes it's necessary.

However, the fact that the reader will be writing and running code in the future isn't a good reason to use future tense. Stick with present tense where possible.

[example.recommend]
Press [guibutton]*OK*. A new dialog *opens*.
[example.avoid]
Press [guibutton]*OK*. A new dialog *will open*.

[example.recommend]
If there is no authenticated user, the method *returns* null.
[example.avoid]
If there is no authenticated user, the method *will return* null.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Will = YES -->]

[[symbols]]
== "And" and "Plus" ("&" and "+")
pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = NO -->]
In text, spell out words like _and_ and _plus_, rather than using symbols such as “&” and “+”.
Screen readers may vary in how they interpret such symbols. You can use the ampersand character "&" in headings and titles, which makes them shorter and easier to scan.

[example.recommend]
The DOM structure of VerticalLayout *and* HorizontalLayout was developed to maintain the same set of elements and …
[example.avoid]
The DOM structure of VerticalLayout *&* HorizontalLayout.

[example.recommend]
Voice *&* Tone _(in a heading or a title)_
[example.avoid]
The voice *&* tone of the documentation is professional and friendly.

[example.recommend]
The identifier consists of its tag *plus* a running counter.
[example.avoid]
The identifier consists of its tag *+* a running counter.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = YES -->]


== Directional Language
Avoid using terms like _on the left_, _above_ or _below_ to describe the location of something on the screen; these terms aren't useful for screen readers.

[example.recommend]
In the previous example.
[example.avoid]
In the example above.


== Latin Abbreviations

Don't use the following Latin abbreviations in normal text, but rather write them in English. Using them inside parenthesis is acceptable, when you want to clarify the meaning of a sentence without distracting or diverging the reader too much.

[[for-example]]
=== "For Example" (E.g.)
Rather use expression such as _such as_, _for example_, or _for instance_.

_For example_ http://www.myenglishteacher.net/forexample.html[always requires] surrounding commas, while _such as_ only requires preceding comma when it's used in the beginning of a restrictive clause.

For example:

[example.recommend]
You may find, *for example*, JSF or Flash more suitable for such purposes.
[example.avoid]
You may find, *e.g.*, JSF or Flash more suitable for such purposes.

[example.recommend]
*For example*, consider that you have the following composite class.
[example.avoid]
*E.g.*, consider that you have the following composite class.

[example.recommend]
You may find frameworks *such as* JSF or Flash more suitable for such purposes.

[example.recommend]
Some frameworks, *such as* JSF or Flash, can be more suitable for such purposes.

[example.recommend]
Due to the way overlays *(e.g., Dialog)* are rendered in embedded Flow UIs, the utility classes don't work in them.


[[that-is]]
=== "That Is" (I.e.)
Rather use "_that is_", surrounded with commas.

[example.recommend]
The parameter is the class name of the widget set, *that is*, without the extension.
[example.avoid]
The parameter is the class name of the widget set, *i.e.*, without the extension.

[example.recommend]
Switches focus between sections of the grid (*i.e.*, header, body, footer).

[[etc]]
=== "And So Forth" (Etc.)
This abbreviation is sometimes fine to use, but you're encouraged to use expressions such as _and so forth_. If used, it should be preceded by comma and followed by period.

[example.recommend]
You would normally implement some views, *etc*.
[example.recommend]
You would normally implement some views, *and so forth*.


== Product Names
Product names, such as _Combo Box_, should be capitalized in the same way as proper nouns and not as class names. A class name can be used if specifically referring to a class (remember to use monospace formatting in such cases). For example:

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ProductName = NO -->]

[example.recommend]
*Combo Box* allows the user to choose a value from a filterable list of options presented in an overlay.
[example.avoid]
*ComboBox* allows the user to choose a value from a filterable list of options presented in an overlay.

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.ProductName = YES -->]

[example.recommend]
The `ComboBox` class extends the `ComboBoxBase` class.

[[vaadin-versions]]
== Vaadin Versions Numbers
Avoid using explicit Vaadin version numbers in text (e.g., _Vaadin 24_). Instead, use the `[role="since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V24"]` tag (or another version number) for those parts of the documentation that apply starting from a specific version.

[example.recommend]
====
`Using the integrated content areas in *+++[since:com.vaadin:vaadin@V23.3]#Tab Sheet#+++* is the easiest way to switch between the different content for each tab.`
====

[example.avoid]
====
`Using the integrated content areas in Tab Sheet *(available in Vaadin 23.3 and later)* is the easiest way to switch between the different content for each tab.`
====

Try to write the documentation for features with the assumption that they are available for general use in their final form, even if they are still under development or only available in a pre-release. This reduces the burden of the reader, once a feature is available in a stable release, as they don't need to pause and think if the documentation is relevant for them. Similarly, don't assume the reader is familiar how things have worked in earlier version of Vaadin, and avoid such comparisons.



== Admonitions
Admonition blocks such as `[NOTE]`, `[TIP]`, or `[WARNING]` can be used to emphasize important issues. However, don't overuse them, as this can interfere with the flow of the text. In general, there should be no more than three admonitions on a page.

Use a descriptive title for admonitions. For example:

[example]
====
.Don't overuse admonitions
[WARNING]
Overusing admonition blocks interrupts the flow.

====


== Capitalization

You should use title or headline case for all titles, including chapter, section, and sub-section titles.

[example]
====

For a detailed description of capitalization rules, see for example:

* http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html[Rules for Capitalization in Titles of Articles], Your Dictionary



== Emphasis
Use the emphasis styles, such as
`+++[+++classname+++]#+++ClassName+++#+++` emphasis for class names and
`+++[+++methodname+++]#+++methodName()+++#+++` for methods.

[%header, cols="2,4,2"]
|====
|Style Element | AsciiDoc Example Code | Result
|Class Names | `+++[classname]`Component`+++` | [classname]`Component`
|Interface Names | `+++[interfacename]`EventListener`+++` | [interfacename]`EventListener`
|Method Names | `+++[methodname]`setValue()`+++` | [methodname]`setValue()`
|Annotation Names | `+++[annotationname]`@Route`+++` | [annotationname]`@Route`
|GUI Buttons | `+++[guibutton]#OK#+++` | [guibutton]#OK#
|GUI Labels | `+++[guilabel]#OK#+++` | [guilabel]#OK#
|File Names | `+++[filename]`readme.txt`+++` | [filename]`readme.txt`
|Other Monospace | `+++`appName`+++` | `appName`
|Key Caps | `+++kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+C]+++` | kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+C]
|Menu Choices | `+++"Help > Updates"+++` or
`+++menu:Help[Updates]+++`| "Help > Updates"
|====


== Method Names
Use empty parentheses at the end of method names to denote that they are methods. In general, don't list parameter types for methods, unless this is required to mention a specific version of a method. It may also be necessary to specify a parameter when it's relevant in the context. For example:


[example.recommend]
Call `setEnabled()` to control if a component is enabled or disabled.
[example.avoid]
Call `setEnabled` to control if a component is enabled or disabled.

[example.recommend]
Call `setEnabled(false)` to disable it.


[[lists]]
== Lists & Oxford Comma
Items in a list can be separated by commas. If a list contains three or more items, and the last item is preceded by a conjunction (_and_, _or_), place a comma before the conjunction. This use of a comma is called the _Oxford comma_. For example:

[example]
====
_The team includes analysts, developers**,** and testers._

_Leave a comment in the forum if you have any doubts, queries**,** or suggestions._
====

// Allow 'separators'
pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Terms = NO -->]

In cases where items in the list themselves contain commas, it's better to use semi-colons as item separators, to avoid confusion. +
For example:

pass:[<!-- vale Vaadin.Terms = YES -->]

[example]
====
This curry has three vital ingredients: onion, potato, and spinach.

This curry has three vital ingredients: onion, which should be roughly chopped**;** potato, which should be diced**;** and fresh spinach leaves, which should be thoroughly washed before use.
====


== Graphics & Images
Graphics can be useful as a way of conveying information quickly and succinctly. However, you need to be conscious that not everybody is able to see graphics clearly or at all.

For this reason, you should also use alternative ways of communicating the information shown in any given graphic. Take care that a reader can get the same information in either way -- text or graphic.
