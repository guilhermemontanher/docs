= Contributing to Documentation
:hide-uri-scheme:

The Vaadin documentation is maintained in https://github.com/vaadin/docs[GitHub], authored using https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc], and built using <<{articles}/tools/dspublisher#,Design System Publisher>>.

The main branches in the repository are `latest`, for the latest version of Vaadin, and `hilla`, for the Hilla documentation.

To learn how to write the AsciiDoc authoring syntax, including all the extensions in Design System Publisher, see the <<{articles}/tools/dspublisher/editing#,Design System Publisher documentation>>. You should also familiarize yourself with the <<guidelines,writing style guidelines>>.

== Edit in GitHub

You can make small corrections or suggestions to the documentation by clicking the [guilabel]*Edit this page on GitHub* link at the end of any page. It opens that page for editing in GitHub (you need a GitHub account), from where you can edit the content, and then continue to submitting a pull request. For external contributors, a fork of the repository is created on your own GitHub account.

The GitHub editor is good for small edits, but not for authoring new pages or large sections. The preview rendering on GitHub doesn't show the content the same way as the official documentation website, as Design System Publisher has custom extensions and styling. To see an exact preview of the page you're editing, you need to run the development server locally.

== Edit Locally

To edit and preview the documentation website locally on your computer, do the following steps:

. Clone the repository. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone http://github.com/vaadin/docs
----
. Start Design System Publisher by running the following command in the `docs` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
cd docs
npm run dspublisher:start
+
You need a commercial Vaadin subscription to run Design System Publisher. Once the development server is up and running, the website should open up in your browser on \http://localhost:8000.

== VS Code

To have a nicer authoring experience, you should install https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[AsciiDoctor] and <<vale#,Vale>> together with the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-vscode[Vale extension]. Vale helps you conform to the documentation writing guidelines, making the PR review process faster.

=== AsciiDoc Settings

When editing an AsciiDoc in VS Code, you might get the following error annotation on the main heading/title of all pages:

----
level 0 sections can only be used when doctype is book
----

Add the following snippet to your VS Code `settings.json` file to avoid it:

.`settings.json`
[source,json]
----
{
    // ...
    "asciidoc.preview.attributes": {
        "doctype": "book"
    },
    // ...
}
----
