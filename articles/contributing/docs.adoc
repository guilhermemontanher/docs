= Contributing to Documentation

== Set Up

. Clone the repository: https://github.com/vaadin/docs
. Start <<{articles}/tools/dspublisher#,Design System Publisher>> by running the following command in the `docs` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
npm run dspublisher:start
+
You need a commercial Vaadin subscription to build the docs website.

To learn more how to author content, see the <<{articles}/tools/dspublisher/editing#,Design System Publisher documentation>>.

== Writing Guidelines

.Install AsciiDoctor and Vale
[TIP]
If you plan to contribute larger amounts of content, you should install https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[AsciiDoctor] and https://vale.sh[Vale] together with the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-vscode[Vale VS Code extension]. Vale helps you conform to the writing guidelines, and makes the PR review process faster.
