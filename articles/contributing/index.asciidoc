== Report Issues

Report issues in relevant repositories on GitHub.
If you are reporting a bug, you can help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible.
Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

Helping to review pull requests is another great way to contribute.
Your feedback can help to shape the implementation of new features.
When reviewing pull requests, however, refrain from approving or rejecting a PR.
